      A data-driven look at how daily habits influence obesity and overall health.

      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Obesity is a growing global health concern, influenced by genetic, environmental,
        and lifestyle factors. This project explores how everyday habits—such as diet, physical activity,
        hydration, and transportation—impact obesity risk. Through data analysis and interactive visualizations,
        we aim to uncover meaningful patterns that can guide healthier choices and public health strategies.

      <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        We use the Obesity Prediction dataset from Kaggle by Ruchika Kumbhar. It contains 2,111 rows and 17 columns,
        including demographic and lifestyle variables like age, height, weight, food frequency, water intake,
        and physical activity. The target variable classifies individuals by obesity level.

      <h2>Summary & Future Work</h2>
      <p> Our analysis highlights how daily habits such as meal frequency, snacking behavior, and physical activity levels are associated with varying obesity levels. The boxplot visualizations show a clear trend where higher obesity categories correspond to increased body weight, while the D3 chart reveals that individuals who "sometimes" snack between meals are the most likely to fall into higher obesity levels. This suggests that irregular or frequent snacking may play a role in weight gain over time. Additionally, visual patterns between height, weight, and age suggest that while these factors contribute, lifestyle behaviors carry significant weight in determining obesity risk.</p>
      <p> Future work could include applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model of obesity risk based on lifestyle features. The dataset could also be further segmented to explore whether specific trends differ across gender or age groups. These extensions would enhance our ability to personalize health recommendations and guide more targeted public health interventions. </p>
